### Brag Sheet
I volunteer at hospitals. Specifically last summer I volunteered at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital. There I had the responsibility of helping nurses, move equipment, and other jobs to help the hospital run smoothly. At school, I participate in the Pre Med Club. I was elected as an executive board member for this club. My job is to design meetings and plan field trips. Furthermore, I won the presidential award for academic excellence.
